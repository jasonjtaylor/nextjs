# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

The Next.js app was designed to walk through the basics of Next.js its folder structure, styling, SEO and data fetching.

The front end built with:

• Next.js
• React
• Mongo DB
• Vercel

Installation

Clone this repository $ git clone https://github.com/jasonjtaylor/nextjs

Install dependencies $ npm install and mongo

Run the app $ npm run dev

Run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view application in the browser.

Thoughts and Lessons learned

Don’t manually install. Use the install code from the Next.js documentation so the boiler plate folder structure is created it will save you time and headaches.

Styling was tricky at first since I have primarily use SASS but once I messed around with it and understood the module.css and global.css structure it started to get easier so stick with it.

The folder structure created when first building the app via npx-create-next is great. Only having to create your components folder and not having to worry about page routes was nice unlike when using React.

Data fetching was different for me than with traditional React. I typically would use Axios to get my data but with Next.js I used fetch() and it seemed to work just as well once I figured it out.

Moving forward, I will continue to use Next.js when building future projects. I am also considering going back on some previous React projects and implementing Next.js to optimize my sites.
